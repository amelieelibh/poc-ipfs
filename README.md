# IOTA IPFS

The IOTA IPFS Demonstration is composed of 2 packages `api` and `client`.

## API

The API facilitates all the services required by `client` web UI. It is a set of services running on NodeJS connecting to the Tangle and IPFS.

See [./api/README.md](./api/README.md) for more details.

## Client

The client package provides a React Web UI to provide facilities to upload and authenticate files using IOTA and IPFS.
